This sample demonstrates how to handle input from different devices on different platforms.

On OS X and Windows, you use the arrow keys to move the character. See the "BEGIN INPUT CODE: KEYBOARD & BASIC CONTROLLER" section in main.lua.

On devices, you use the on-screen display. See the "BEGIN INPUT CODE: TOUCH" section in main.lua.

On devices with a joystick connected, you use the joystick. See the "BEGIN INPUT CODE: KEYBOARD & BASIC CONTROLLER" section in main.lua.

Joysticks with an analog stick are also supported. See the "BEGIN INPUT CODE: ADVANCED CONTROLLER" section in main.lua.
