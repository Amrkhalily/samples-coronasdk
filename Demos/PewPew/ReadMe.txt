This is a simple game where you can run around using gamepad/joystick (or keyboard) and shoot your friends (and enemies).

Each player uses a device. Plug in a joystick, press "Configure Player". Some controllers come preconfigured with controls and do not need to be configured. Use a button on the controller you want to use and then press buttons/use axes to set up controls. If you want to reconfigure controls press "Configure controller" and repeat the process.


Only the OS X simulator and Android devices support joysticks.


Have Fun!
